# Visualizing Numbers


**This repository is made for Math Appreciation through Data Visualization in Python. All codefiles are coded by me in Python, and visualized through the
wonderfully complex MatPlotLib.**

My Inspirations for visualizing numbers are the youtubers 3Blue1Brown (Do check him out; he makes absolutely wonderful animations using MANIM for Python), 
and NumberPhile (Excellent explanations for seemingly complicated topics) .

I often see a Reddit/StackExchange Post, regarding a mathematical theory or question, which really fascinates me. The solutions, or approaches to solving such
a question almost always requires mapping the problem geometrically, to gain a deeper understanding of it. A plus point is, these geometrical representations
are so visually pleasing to the eye, that it is almost impossible to not fall in love with numbers after seeing them.


Each file in this repository is a small piece of code meant to visualize some mathematical pattern or question. In each files README, I will try my very best to
explain the reason to why this happens.

Files included and their READMEs:
#### polar.py
#### fibonacci.py

### Natural Number Spirals
#### Take a set of consecutive natural numbers, say 0,1,2,3. Now, just for fun, map each number as (number +number*i) on a polar graph. Why do we get spirals?
