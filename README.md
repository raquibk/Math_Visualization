# Visualizing Numbers
This repository is made purely for Math Appreciation through Data Visualization in Python. All codefiles are coded by me in Python, and visualized through the
wonderfully complex MatPlotLib. 


I often see a Reddit/StackExchange Post, regarding a mathematical theory or question, which really fascinates me. The solutions, or approaches to solving such
a question almost always requires mapping the problem geometrically, to gain a deeper understanding of it. A plus point is, these geometrical representations
are so visually pleasing to the eye, it is almost impossible to not fall in love with numbers after seeing them.
