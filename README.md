# Visualizing Numbers


**This repository is made for Math Appreciation through Data Visualization in Python. All codefiles are coded by me in Python, and visualized through the
wonderfully complex MatPlotLib.**

My Inspirations for visualizing numbers are the youtubers 3Blue1Brown (Do check him out; he makes absolutely wonderful animations using MANIM for Python), 
and NumberPhile (Excellent explanations for seemingly complicated topics) .

I often see a Reddit/StackExchange Post, regarding a mathematical theory or question, which really fascinates me. The solutions, or approaches to solving such
a question almost always requires mapping the problem geometrically, to gain a deeper understanding of it. A plus point is, these geometrical representations
are so visually pleasing to the eye, that it is almost impossible to not fall in love with numbers after seeing them.


Each file in this repository is a small piece of code meant to visualize some mathematical pattern or question. In each files README, I will try my very best to
explain the reason to why this happens.

Files included and their READMEs:
#### polar.py
#### fibonacci.py

### Approximation of pi using polar graphs
#### Take a set of consecutive natural numbers, say 0,1,2,3. Now, just for fun, map each number as (number +number*i) on a polar graph. Why do we get spirals? And further,
#### how is this even related to approximating pi?

Spirals generated by the first 10000 natural numbers

The answer is very satisfying. Take the first five numbers for instance. Now we plot them as 1+i, 2+2i, and so on. The first point is 1 radian away from the x axis, the second
point is 2 radians away, and so on. This creates a very gentle winding pattern for the natural number, which when zoomed out, looks like spirals.

Now, where does the pi approximation come from? Here, take a look at 3 + 3i:

</p>


It is quite close to pi, since 3+3i is 3 radians away from the x-axis, and pi is 3.14 (3 ~ 3.14). Now take a look at 44+44i:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/raquibk/Math_Visualization/blob/master/N44.png" alt="44+44i"/>
</p>

It is clearly seen that to plot 44+44i, we wind round the axis 7 times. '44i' corresponds to '44/2pi' rotations, so we can safely say:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/raquibk/Math_Visualization/blob/master/Nformula.png" alt="2pi"/>
</p>

Simplify this, and we get the famous approximation for pi:

This is one of many example of how pi hides in whole numbers. The same spiral pattern can be repeated for prime numbers, and pi can be obtained again.

Running instructions for the code: (MatPlotLib library required) Simple run the code, type in the number of natural numbers you want to be graphed (N<10,000) and hit enter to get the graphical representation.
